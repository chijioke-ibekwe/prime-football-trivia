# Prime Football Trivia
RESTful APIs for a trivia game to test your football knowledge. As a lover of football and having played a number of trivia games online that weren't challenging enough, I was inspired to work on this project. If you think you know football, play the Prime Football Trivia ðŸ˜Œ. Frontend component of the application to be integrated soon.

## Getting Started

### Install Dependencies

1. **Python 3.7** - Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)

2. **Virtual Environment** - We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

3. **PIP Dependencies** - Once your virtual environment is setup and running, install the required dependencies by navigating to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Key Pip Dependencies

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use to handle the lightweight SQL database. You'll primarily work in `app.py`and can reference `models.py`.

- [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross-origin requests from our frontend server.

### Set up the Database

With Postgres running, create a `prime-football-trivia` database:

```bash
createbd prime-football-trivia
```

Populate the database using the `prime-football-trivia.psql` file provided. From the `backend` folder in terminal run:

```bash
psql prime-football-trivia < prime-football-trivia.psql
```

### Run the Server

From within the `/backend` directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

```bash
flask run --reload
```

The `--reload` flag will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.
